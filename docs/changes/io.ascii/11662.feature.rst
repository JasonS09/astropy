Added support for reading and writing multidimensional column data (masked and
unmasked) to ECSV. Also added formal support for reading and writing object-type
column data which can contain items consisting of lists, dicts, and basic scalar
types. This can be used to store columns of variable-length arrays. Both of
these features use JSON to convert the object to a string that is stored in the
ECSV output.
