For conversion between FITS tables and astropy ``Table``, the standard mask
values of ``NaN`` for float and null string for string are now properly
recognized, leading to a ``MaskedColumn`` with appropriately set mask
instead of a ``Column`` with those values exposed. Conversely, when writing
an astropy ``Table`` to a FITS tables, masked values are now consistently
converted to the standard FITS mask values of ``NaN`` for float and null
string for string (i.e., not just for tables with ``masked=True``, which no
longer is guaranteed to signal the presence of ``MaskedColumn``).
