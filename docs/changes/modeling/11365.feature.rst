Added a state attribute to models to allow preventing the synching of
constraint values from the constituent models. This synching can
greatly slow down fitting if there are large numbers of fit parameters.
model.sync_constraints = True means check constituent model constraints
for compound models every time the constraint is accessed, False, do not.
Fitters that support constraints will set this to False on the model copy
and then set back to True when the fit is complete before returning.
