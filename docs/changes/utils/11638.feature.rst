Change the Time and IERS leap second handling so that the leap second table is
updated only when a Time transform involving UTC is performed. Previously this
update check was done the first time a ``Time`` object was created, which in
practice occured when importing common astropy subpackages like
``astropy.coordinates``. Now you can prevent querying internet resources (for
instance on a cluster) by setting ``iers.conf.auto_download = False``. This can
be done after importing astrpoy but prior to performing any ``Time`` scale
transformations related to UTC.
